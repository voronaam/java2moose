JVM byte code parser for FreeMiner/Minetest
===
This is a playground project that seeks to extract some very basic information about java program and write a Freeminer/Minetest
map out of it.

This can be used as a way to bring to live and interactive visualization of any JVM (Java, Scala, etc) code.

Current version outputs an SQL script that could be executed against an existing sqlite3 database defining the map.
Leveldb is not supported (yet).
